# Tutorial: Setting up a development environment

**This tutorial is perfect for you if you wish to set up a locally running development environment for Nextcloud development and Nextcloud app development. Depending on your operating system, it may take between half an hour to a few hours to set up.**

**If you are just looking for something quick for a little bit of experimenting or for a workshop, you might prefer to use the [DevContainer](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/tree/master/.devcontainer) instead in combination with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). That would give you a development environment in which you can follow the app tutorials with just a few clicks.**

**In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up your development environment using Docker. After this tutorial you will know:**

* **How to install the Docker Desktop app on your machine**
* **How to run Nextcloud locally**

**‚ÑπÔ∏è The tutorial assumes that you have a freshly installed operating system.**  
This means tutorial will likely not work if you already have Docker installed, or if you already have containers running, or if any other process is running on port 80. Also make sure to be logged into your computer as an admin user and not with any secondary user or guest user account.

We also assume that for the steps that require a browser, you use **Firefox**.

The steps of the tutorial are different depending of your operating system, so we provided separate tutorials for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.

This Docker development container is maintained by Julius in his free time. That unfortunately does mean that there are some areas that have not been thoroughly tested. If this container has been helpful for you, maybe you can send him a thank you note. üôè Contributions for fixing issues or reporting issues would also be welcomed [here](https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev).
