* **How to create a simple interface-only app**
* **How to compile JavaScript**
* **How to use network requests**

**The tutorial will guide you through the steps to create a standalone app that displays a list of cat GIFs.**

## Required knowledge:

For this tutorial we assume you have followed the previous tutorials on how to set up a development environment, and creating a Hello World app.

This tutorial is for anyone who is new to developing Nextcloud apps but do have a working development environment and are familiar with the structure of the skeleton app.

::: warn
In the tutorial we assume you have a development environment created through the Nextcloud Docker setup. This is the only Nextcloud instance that you need for this tutorial. Everything will happen in this instance.

## Features:

* List the cat GIF files that you have stored in a folder in the app directory
* Display the cat GIFs through a simple button-click
* Cat GIFs can sometimes be scary and frighten away your users. ðŸ™€ Adjust the size of the cat GIFs through a simple button click and store this setting for future visits!

## Screenshots:

When opening the app, you see a list of the cat GIFs stored in the img/gif directory:
